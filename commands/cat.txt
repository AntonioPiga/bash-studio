cat is a command used to concatenate files and print their contents to the standard output (usually the terminal).
It's also used to create, display, or concatenate files.
It's similar to ->print(), System.out.println() ...
It's very versatile and can be used in combination with other commands and pipes to manipulate text and files.
It's useful for quickly viewing the contents of a text file or concatenating multiple files together.
To display the content of a file with cat, you can use the command:

'cat {fileName}'
